					<i>"Don't compromise yourself. You are all you've got." - Janis Joplin</i>

					
					<p>If you believe the phrase you are what you think, then life truly stems from your thoughts. But we cannot rely purely on thoughts; we must translate thoughts into words and eventually into actions in order to manifest our intentions. This means we have to be very careful with our words, choosing to speak only those which work towards our benefit and cultivate our highest good. Affirmations help purify our thoughts and restructure the dynamic of our brains so that we truly begin to think nothing is impossible. The word affirmation comes from the Latin affirmare, originally meaning "to make steady, strengthen."</p>
					<p>Affirmations do indeed strengthen us by helping us believe in the potential of an action we desire to manifest. When we verbally affirm our dreams and ambitions, we are instantly empowered with a deep sense of reassurance that our wishful words will become reality.
					</p>
					<p>Affirmations are proven methods of self-improvement because of their ability to rewire our brains. Much like exercise, they raise the level of feel-good hormones and push our brains to form new clusters of "positive thought" neurons. In the sequence of thought-speech-action, affirmations play an integral role by breaking patterns of negative thoughts, negative speech, and, in turn, negative actions.</p>

					<p>The art of the spoken word is critical in crafting our futures. As I have went through lot of artical and research materials, it is my belief that we influence the universe word by word. If we dictate to it our wishes, it will respond. When we utter a sound, we emit a sound wave into the universe. This sound wave pierces through the air and becomes a real object. It therefore exists in our world, intangible and invisible. No words are empty words, as every syllable we speak engages energy towards or against us. If you constantly say "I can't," the energy of your words will repel the universal force against you. But if you say "I can!" the universe will endow you with the abilities to do just that. So speak away; relinquish your fears and purge your anger, predict your own future and live up to your potential with the values values that are important to you and that will change your life.</p>
					<h3>I read through the list and the following values resonated with me:</h3>
					<UL>
						<li>Ambition</li>
						<li>Achievement</li>
						<li>Accomplishment</li>
						<li>Challenge</li>
						<li>Enthusiasm</li>
						<li>Integrity</li>
						<li>Knowledge</li>
						<li>Loyalty</li>
						<li>Personal development</li>
						<li>Truth</li>
						<li>Will-power</li>
					</UL>

					<h3>Important Values</h3>
					<i>Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.
Helen Keller</i>
					<p>Since from the school age every child are moulded with values given by parents, teachers and people in touch with them. Values are important in every ones life.
						Selecting important values and stick to it is very difficulties. In my life value as "Ambition" played vital role and has been the driving force behind each of the life events I mentioned earlier. The absence of ambitition I would have never moved from my down fall. The lack of ambition would have never bring me to USA for masters in computer science from NYIT, New York. Lastly, without ambition I would not have join Dev Bootcamp.</p>
						<h3>Rating Values</h3>
						<UL>
						<li>Ambition 	5</li>
						<li>Achievement 	3</li>
						<li>Accomplishment 	4</li>
						<li>Challenge 	4</li>

					</UL>
					<h3>Advice</h3>
					<i>"Everything is okay in the end, so if it's not okay, then it's not the end yet."</i>

					<p>It’s your life. Just breathe. It’s good to be motivated, but sometimes just taking the pressure off is the most effective way to accomplish a big goal.</p><p>

It’s a lesson that took me a long time to learn: just because you’re happy with where you’re at doesn’t mean you don’t want to be inspired or aim higher. Being at peace in the moment will only help you attract more success into your life.</p><p>

Peace isn’t some distant goal to work toward. It’s something that can be cultivated on a daily basis to help you achieve your goals in a health way.</p><p>

Active contentment is growth. It’s a state of mind that allows for ambition as well as peace. I challenge you to be actively content with your life. Namaste!</p>
					<h3>Values and Stereotype Threat</h3>
					<p>The values I have mentioned haven't changed in quite some time and with each life experience they are almost always strengthened. Values gives the ability to keep movitated moving and strength to fight and find solution against stereotype threat. </p>
