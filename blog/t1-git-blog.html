					<p>What are the benefits of version control?</p>
					<p><UL><li>It provides one code for an entire team to use; everybody operates version'.</li>
						<li>Changes are orderly and avoid overwriting , saving development time.</li>
						<li>The ability to track changes and makes it easier to find the right person whom made changes and when.</li>
						<li>A list of exact changes made can be generated quickly and easily, making it easier to advise users of the information on how it has changed from version to version.</li>
