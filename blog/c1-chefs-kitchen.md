Experience is not what happens to a man. It is what a man does with what happens to him. ~Aldous Leonard Huxley<BR>

First week is about to complete at DCB of Phase-0. Enjoyed working througt challenges and time management with present work and school. As the day were passing I started Loving to code throught command prompt, git bash and working on soft skill. Usually I use to on internet for longer time just to play games and facebook. But form last week I chacged my focus to learn form about Technologies, what happning in market, Meditation and Reading blog. It's drastic change in life... I am not kidding, I am writing my first blog..

How it all started, I’ve heard about DBC from my brother. Due to the career switch after my Bachelor’s in Computer Science I lost my touch, so I enrolled myself for Master in CS at NYIT, New York. But didn’t worked out for me. Start looking different option. When my brother told me about Dev Bootcamp in New York.  
So after doing enough reasearch thorouh Google, Quora and websites of various bootcamps including Dev Bootcamp I reached a conclusion that Dev Bootcamp best suits my need. With high technical abilities of mentors, level and diversity of students and approximates hiring stats quoted of sites like Quora and Dev bootcamps outrech It will give me exactly what I need i.e. will help me in joing and helping budding Tech Startup Ecosystem in NY or anywhere in country. Attending Dev Bootcamp not only make me better developer, also help me to grow social network in tech world which will help me to find job and start my career. 

Let dive into coding and developing ourself!!! Happy Coding
