				<div> <h1>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h1>
					<i>Ongoing Learning process!!!</i>
					<p><h3 ID="tag">Great Experience!!!<br>Date: 11/10/2014</h3></p>
					<i>Software innovation, like almost every other kind of innovation, requires the ability to collaborate and share ideas with other people, and to sit down and talk with customers and get their feedback and understand their needs. ~ Bill Gates</i>

					
					<p>Pairing has been a really decent experience for me, both technically and culturally. On the technical side, I've possessed the capacity to see other individuals' manner of thinking and diverse approaches and methods. Pairing with more knowledgeable individuals has also allowed me to understand new ideas and cement different ideas that were still not 100% acquired.</p>
					<p>Culturally, pairing has allowed me to feel exchange encounters with different mates and feel part of a community of individuals experiencing a common methodology.
					</p>
					<p>I would say that in general pairing is fun, it is challenging to speak up your ideas when you're not completely beyond any doubt about them however as time passes by it gets easier. Having your pair to listen and provide for you feedback on your ideas is also something I value about pairing. </p>
					<p>Feeling comfortable about giving include or proposing an alternate path is not always easy for me, this is something that has changed since the starting and I feel more comfortable now than then.</p>
					<p>I would say that the most frustrating moment is the point at which you think you have an answer and the tests still fail. That inclination of hitting your head against a wall is discouraging however it feels better to realize that you are not alone. Having the capacity to joke about it and keeping a decent comical inclination when failing at tackling a problem shows you a mental a bit of mercy and allows you to escape from that negative mentality. </p>
					<p>Feedback related encounters have been great, a learning knowledge. Getting feedback is intriguing. Getting to know other individuals' viewpoint on a pairing session complements the feedback you get straightforwardly from them amid the session. Most of the time you improve worded variant of that original feedback that comments on some particular moments of the session and why those moments were important to that individual. This is really great because it helps you concentrate on your behavior in certain situations and not simply a general feeling of how great or bad you were amid that session. </p>
					<p>I would say that in general the feedback I've gotten has been valuable, it has helped me to concentrate on my weakest focuses and has also made me feel more certain about certain things I wasn't certain I was doing admirably. For example, I know I have to be more certain about communicating my ideas, I also ought to improve in my utilization of pseudocode. I'm attempting to improve both of this abilities session by session and getting feedback reminds me to concentrate on them amid sessions.</p>
