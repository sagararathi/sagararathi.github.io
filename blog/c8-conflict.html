					<p><h3 ID="tag">Reflection on Conflict<br>Date: 11/10/2014</h3></p>
					<i>"Whenever you're in conflict with someone, there is one factor that can make the difference between damaging your relationship and deepening it. That factor is attitude. ~ William James</i>

					
					<p>Every persone at sometime in his life have conflict at home, work place, social life etc. And Its the part of human nature you dont have to wory of but one has to think off to to resolve those conflict. Thinking back on times in my life I came to the realization that internal conflict (with myself) has occured far more than with others.</p>
					<p>I am anxious person, that is main reason of my conflict with me and others. It took me many years, Learning to step back from a situation and rationalize has helped me overcome worries/thoughts for that time.
					</p>
					<p>Initially it helped me, But what I didn't know at the time was that avoidance would work in the short term though in the long term would prove to be detrimental. Now, while not always the easiest thing to do , I make it a point to enter the situation. When struggles arise, through assistance I have received and learned mechanisms, I do my best to rationalize my thought process, giving importance to what is relevant to the task at hand.</p>

					<p>To avoid conflict I try to follow the folling list to minimize the effect:</p>
					
					<UL>
						<li> Understand nobody is perfect and learning effective conflict resolution is a life-long process.</li>
						<li> Be specific about what you need.</li>
						<li>Before speaking, ask yourself, "Is it kind? Is it necessary? Is it true?"</li>
						<li>Be willing to let go and "reboot." </li>
						<li>Understand conflict is neither bad, wrong nor a sign of failure. </li>
						<li>Do not triangulate.</li>
						<li>Respond from a place of sadness, rather than anger. </li>
						
					</UL>
					<i>Peace is not absence of conflict, it is the ability to handle conflict by peaceful means.</i>
