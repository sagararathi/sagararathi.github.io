				<div> <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
					<i>How stereotypes shape intellectual identity and performance!!!</i>
					<p><h3 ID="tag">Date: 11/15/2014</h3></p>
					<i>Stereotype threat is a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group.</i>
					<h2>What Is Stereotype Threat?</h2>
					
					<p>Stereotype threat is a self-confirming belief that one may be evaluated based on a negative stereotype. Because of stereotype threat, Person who are reminded of negative stereotypes about their race or gender before taking a test perform worse, especially if the negative stereotype is one that makes them feel inferior. The anxiety of confirming a negative stereotype seems to be the driving force behind stereotype threat. That anxiety causes they to perform worse than they would have otherwise. Stereotype threat is a reminder of how social forces can influence test scores, including intelligence scores.</p>
					<h2>My Personal Stereotype Threat?</h2>
					<p>I am fortunate enough to have not experienced Stereotype Threat in my childhood; But I have experienced it! while started my flying carrer back in New Zealand.
					</p>
					<p>I was not aware of any difficulties as pilot. When I started with my career I realized flying an aircraft is not easy, always there is challenging situation with changing weather and mechanical failure. Due to anxiety my confidence level decreased and I was taking longer time to learn flying maneuvers. I realized my problem and started reading Human factors and discussing with my instructor.   It seems that becoming aware of stereotype threat can help reduce some of the effects. While going for flying I started adopting positive role model and more over I am thankful to my instructor by encouraging me, that I can handle difficult task and achieve high standards. </p>
					<h2>My Realization</h2>
					<p>I realize nothing is impossible if tried hard enough to achieve. I am simply an individual who happens to not have any flying experience. I am a student at Flight training manawatu learning to fly many people canâ€™t even think of. I was struggling because it was new to me, and that doesn't necessarily have to have meaning. Although it's very elementary, my biggest realization is that I am who I am at this point in time. All I can do is strive to be better than I was yesterday. I keep my motivated and dont give up easily.</p>
