				<div> <h1>Life At DBC.</h1>
					<p><h3 ID="tag">Third Week at DBC<br>Date: 10/26/2014</h3></p>
					<p>Though my third weeks at DBC, I feel more confident and technical updated with Ruby, HTML, CSS and Git.  </p>
					<p>Being a Master student in computer science at New York institute of Technologies, I hardly had knowledge about programing. All the subject are theoretical and no practical programing knowledge. So I had left with option of Learning on your own with material available online is isolating and frustrating. Trying to achive required skill set was hard because I was always in confusion what to study, where to study and when to study. After deciding on material was very difficult to focus and motivate throughout the course. And more over if you hit any road block that would derail me for few hours or even days and due to which I loose track. </p>
					<p>The Curriculum at DBC is chosen and updated as per Market required, which removes doubt as to whether you are studying the right stuff at the time. </p>
					<p>From last three weeks I notice one thing my learning process is expidite because there is always someone to help you or make you understand is you hit road block. At DBC, you learn all new technologies from the very beginning which helps to clear the concepts.  </p>
					<p>Lastly DBC creats communities of all classmated which supports as group and give  foundation of pair programing.</p>
					<p>Hardest part uptill now! Figuring out how much time to devote to cover curriculum and lot of other resources available on internet. Eager to learn new concept always drive me towards rabbit hole. To avoid this I always to to keep focus on current unit I'm going through.</p>
					<h3 ID="tag">Learning Style</h3>
					<p>Asked to take a quiz to figure out our thinking and learning style, Before I start Phase 0</p>
					<p>The Gregorc Thinking Styles places people into one (or more) of four categories:</p>
					<UL>
						<li>Concrete Sequential</li>
						<li>Abstract Sequential</li>
						<li>Concrete Random</li>
						<li>Abstract Random</li>

					</UL>
					<br>
					<p>My primary learning style tends towrds Concrete Sequential, This quality enables you to register information directly through your five senses: sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing. When you are using your concrete ability, you are dealing with the obvious, the "here and now." You are not looking for hidden meanings, or making relationships between ideas or concepts.  Allows your mind to organize information in a linear, step-by-step manner.  know that I enjoy the analytical inclinations of an CS These have always been my comfort zones while in traditional eductional environments.</p>
					<p>With growth mindset, Where one push himself to grabe every instance opportunity for learning, development, growth. I am trying to grab all new challenges</p>
					<p style="font-style: italic">Would you like me to give you a formula for success? It's quite simple, really. Double your rate of failure. Thomas Watson</p>
