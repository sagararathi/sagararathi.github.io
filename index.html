				<p ID="abt1">I am an Engineer by degree, my curiosity to learn new stuff and risk taking ability took me to aviation Industry and I become a Pilot. However after a while when I relized my passion to learn new techs is bot being satisfied by being Pilot Thus I started some self-exploration. This helped me realized that my risk taking nature and quest to continuously learn can only be satisfied by working in a dynamic startup environment. However I also realized that during this process I lost my edge of technical skills to crack a job at a tech startup. So thats why I decided to join a bootcamp which will equip me with latest technologies and skills needed for these type of jobs. So after doing enough reasearch thorouh Google, Quora and websites of various bootcamps including Dev Bootcamp I reached a conclusion that Dev Bootcamp best suits my need. With high technical abilities of mentors, level and diversity of students and approximates hiring stats quoted of sites like Quora and Dev bootcamps outrech It will give me exactly what I need i.e. will help me in joing and helping budding Tech Startup Ecosystem in NY or anywhere in country. Attending Dev Bootcamp not only make me better developer, also help me to grow social network in tech world which will help me to find job and start my career</p>
